Iâ€™m a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with a strong background in mathematics, statistics, and software engineering. I specialize in building end-to-end data solutionsâ€”from cleaning and transforming raw data to deploying scalable machine learning models that drive real business impact.

With hands-on experience in Python, SQL, C++, and frameworks like TensorFlow, Iâ€™ve worked across the full data pipeline: ETL, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and production deployment. My foundation in software engineering enables me to create robust, maintainable systems that scale efficiently.

I also bring practical experience in database design and management, ensuring high data integrity and performance in large-scale analytics environments. I thrive in collaborative, cross-functional teams and enjoy solving complex problems that require both technical expertise and strategic thinking.

Iâ€™m committed to continuous learning and staying current with the latest developments in data science, machine learning, and AI to create value in dynamic, fast-paced environments.
